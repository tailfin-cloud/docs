## Three-step workflow

### 1. Usage event ingestion
Get data into Tailfin via our API. A usage event can be anything that could result in a charge for your customers or can be considered later to include in pricing. For example, if you have a CI/CD product, these can include active or paralell jobs, build minutes, network traffic, storage used or other product-related actions.

### 2. Event processing
Tailfin processes your usage events continously, allowing you to keep your metrics updated in real-time. Once the data is ingested, Tailfin aggregates them into usage metrics defined by you. For example, you can define a metric called "Paralell jobs" and Tailfin will aggregate the maximum number of jobs by each customer over a given time period.

### 3. Usage data extraction, analytics and prediction
The usage data is available via real-time APIs to power your dashboards, analytics, and notifications, as well as to provide real-time visibility to your customers and sales teams. Tailfin also provides a user interface to visualize your data and provide insights into your customers usage. Run various pricing model simulations to calculate historical and future revenue based on usage. Get timely notifications about customers approaching their usage limits or churning. Usage data can also be exported to your data warehouse for further analysis and billing.
